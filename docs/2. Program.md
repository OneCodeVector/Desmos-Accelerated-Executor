# **Get Started:** *-Dax Objects*
**Dax Objects** are how Dax communicates to the calculator API. There are two types of objects, the **Parent Object** and the **Child Objects**.  

The **Parent Object** class communicates to all the child objects through some basic functions. To make a parent object, define an object var with the parent perameters. 

```js
const Main_Object = new DAX_OBJECT(
    DAX_PARENT_OBJECT, {
        Element: DAX_MAIN_ELEMENT, // A Div that contains Dax
    }    
)
```

There are many types of **Child Objects** the one we will focus on is the screen where the graph is displayed and you can communicate directly to the API, (like a wrapper). Start by creating a new screen object with the object peraeters.

```js
const Screen = new DAX_OBJECT(
    DAX_CHILD_OBJECT, {
        Element: DAX_DISPLAY_SCREEN, // Display Div
    }
)
```

# **Get Started:** *-Graphing*
There is no defined object for the graph, instead you load the graph into the screen object.

```js 
const Graph = Main_Object.loadGraph(Screen)
```
There are many functions the graph can run. A list will be provided below.
- Add an expression  
  ```js
  Graph.addLine("y=x")
  ```
- Set/Edit already added lines  
  ```js
  Graph.setLine({Line: 1, Latex: "y=x^2"})
  ```
- Start the graph execution, and run a function every clock tick  
  ```js
  Graph.startExecution(MyGameLoopFunction)
  ```
- Run a function every time the graph is ticked. *(Must be in the main loop)*
  ```js
  Graph.onTick(MyTickFunciton())
  ```
- Stop updating the graph  
  ```js
  Graph.stopExecution()
  ```
